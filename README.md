JSMEA ISO 19848-2018 - Standardized Vessel Dataset (SVD) for Noon Reports
This relational model was created on a SQL Server 2019 Standard instance.  
The JSMEA_ISO_149849.bak is a FULL backup of the schema, including an ERD & Data Dictionary.
Other RDBMS systems can use the JSMEA_All_Objects_v1.0.sql to build the schema.
JSMEA_ISO_19848-2018_1.jpg is a screenshot of the ERD.
JSMEA_Data_Dictionary_1.xlsx is a formated dump of the Data Dictionary.
Other files of note are an Access database prototype, and several source files that the model is based on.
